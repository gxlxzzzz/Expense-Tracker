## Context

Purely a project intended for personal use, i've found often i'm getting paid and
having very little tracking of my finances. Being 18 obviously im not perfect at
managing my money, usually i'll have some cool hobby related items to buy on payday.

Then it's a scroll through amazon at a few things ive been eyeing for a while... next 
I know ive spent a lot more than I had originally intended to. Couple that with social
outings and suddenly that minimum wage part-time jewellery shop wage is looking a lot
more like that one crumpled note in that one pair of jeans you just cant be bothered
to empty the pockets of (especially because it's stuck in that stupid little hole
inside your right hand pocket!)

So anyway I thought why not use my knowledge of PHP from my T level and put it to some good use 
building myself a semi intelligent spending tracker while also making a portfolio piece
out of it, hence why some of the features won't actually be much use for me. See the designs
where I talk about household bills... Thankfully my parents deal with all that! But I know for
literally everyone in the adult world who isn't filthy rich budgeting isn't just useful it's a genuine
NEED.

Triple whammy. Keeps me sharp (Not C sharp tho), Makes a great portfolio piece AND could genuinely help 
people get by in the new world.
